Creating a to-do list app with authentication using Django involves several steps:

1. Set up a new Django project: Start by creating a new Django project using the command django-admin startproject todo_list_project.
2. Create a new app: Within the project, create a new app for the to-do list feature using python (link unavailable) startapp todo_list.
3. Define models: In the todo_list app, define a model for the to-do list items (e.g., TodoItem) using Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system.
4. Create views: Write views to handle requests and responses for the to-do list app (e.g., TodoItemListView, TodoItemCreateView, etc.).
5. Implement authentication: Use Django's built-in authentication system to allow users to register, log in, and log out. You'll need to create a user model and configure authentication views and URLs.
6. Create templates: Design HTML templates for the to-do list app, including a list view, detail view, and forms for creating and editing items.
7. Write URL patterns: Define URL patterns to map URLs to views.
8. Add authentication to views: Use Django's authentication decorators (e.g., @login_required) to restrict access to authenticated users.
9. Test and deploy: Test your app thoroughly and deploy it to a production environment.

Some key Django concepts you'll use in this project include:

- Models and the ORM
- Views and templates
- URL patterns and routing
- Authentication and authorization
- Forms and validation



Let's break down the project into smaller components:

Component 1: Todo List App

- Allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) todo list items
- Each item has a title, description, due date, and completion status
- Users can view a list of all their todo items, filter by completed/uncompleted, and sort by due date

Component 2: Authentication

- Users can register with a username, email, and password
- Users can log in and log out of the app
- Authentication is handled using Django's built-in auth system
- Passwords are hashed and stored securely

Component 3: Authorization

- Only authenticated users can access the todo list app
- Users can only view and edit their own todo list items
- Permissions are handled using Django's built-in permission system

Technical Requirements

- Backend: Django (Python)
- Database: Relational database (e.g., SQLite)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional)
- Deployment: Can be deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku) or a virtual private server (VPS)

Features

- User registration and login/logout functionality
- Todo list item CRUD operations
- Filtering and sorting of todo list items
- Due date reminders 
- User profile management

Next Steps

- Set up a new Django project and app
- Define the TodoItem model and user model
- Create views and templates for the todo list app
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Test and deploy the app
